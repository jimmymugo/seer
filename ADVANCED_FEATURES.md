# üöÄ Advanced EPL Prediction Features

This document outlines the advanced features implemented in the EPL Player Prediction system, taking it from a basic MVP to a sophisticated prediction engine.

## üìä Advanced Metrics Integration

### Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Assists (xA)
- **Implementation**: Calculated based on historical performance and minutes played
- **Formula**: 
  - xG = (goals_scored √ó 0.8) + (minutes_played / 90 √ó 0.1)
  - xA = (assists √ó 0.7) + (minutes_played / 90 √ó 0.05)
- **Usage**: More accurate goal/assist prediction than raw statistics

### Defensive Metrics
- **Tackles**: Per-90 minute tackle rate for defenders and midfielders
- **Interceptions**: Per-90 minute interception rate
- **Clean Sheets**: Historical clean sheet performance
- **Goals Conceded**: For goalkeepers and defenders

### Advanced Performance Metrics
- **Shots on Target**: Estimated based on goals scored
- **Key Passes**: Estimated based on assists
- **Big Chances Created**: Estimated based on assists
- **Per-90 Metrics**: All stats normalized to 90-minute basis

## üîÑ Exponential Weighting System

### Recent Form Weighting
- **Decay Factor**: 0.8 (recent matches weighted more heavily)
- **Formula**: Weighted average = Œ£(points_i √ó decay_factor^i) / Œ£(decay_factor^i)
- **Benefit**: Captures hot streaks and recent performance trends

### Time-Based Weighting
- **Last 2 matches**: 64% weight
- **Matches 3-5**: 36% weight
- **Older matches**: Minimal impact

## üéØ Opponent-Adjusted Statistics

### Fixture Difficulty Adjustment
- **Base Difficulty**: 3.0 (neutral)
- **Adjustment Factor**: 10% reduction per difficulty level above 3
- **Formula**: adjusted_stats = base_stats √ó (1 - (difficulty - 3.0) √ó 0.1)

### Team Strength Context
- **Defensive Strength**: Opponent's defensive rating
- **Attacking Strength**: Opponent's attacking rating
- **Home/Away Factor**: Performance adjustment based on venue

## üè• Player Availability & Risk Assessment

### Rotation Risk Calculation
- **Minutes Consistency**: Standard deviation of recent minutes played
- **Average Minutes**: Mean minutes over last 5 matches
- **Risk Formula**: (1 - avg_minutes/90) + (1 - minutes_consistency)

### Injury & Suspension Tracking
- **Injury Status**: Fit, Doubtful, Injured
- **Likelihood to Start**: Based on chance_of_playing_next_round
- **Suspension Status**: Available, Suspended
- **Expected Return Date**: For injured players

### Team Context
- **Fixture Congestion**: Number of matches in next 7 days
- **Team Form**: Recent team performance (last 5 matches)
- **Weather Conditions**: Match day weather impact
- **Referee**: Historical performance with specific referees
