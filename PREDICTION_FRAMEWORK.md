## ‚ö° MVP Formula

The recommended MVP formula balances raw statistics with contextual factors:

```
Predicted Points = 
  (Recent Form √ó 0.4) + 
  (xG + xA adjusted for opponent) √ó 0.4 + 
  (Home/Away Factor) + 
  (Team Attack/Defense Strength √ó 0.2) - 
  (Rotation/Injury Risk Penalty)
```

### Formula Components:
- **Recent Form (40%)**: Last 5 matches average points
- **Expected Performance (40%)**: xG + xA adjusted for opponent strength
- **Home/Away Factor**: +10% at home, -10% away
- **Team Context (20%)**: Team's attacking/defensive strength
- **Risk Penalty**: Deduction for rotation/injury risk
